# Your rule content

- always adhere to .cursorrules and whatever is listed here is only additional, not a replacement
- make sure to add comments throughout the code files
-makes sure you follow the rules, and ask questions if you need to
- Whenever you are done with each request and ask me "would you like me to: ..." and give a list of items, I would like you to include benefits of each suggestion, whether we havepreviously implemented related items, and the specific item, feature, component it will affect


- I do not accept anything mediocre and I expect you to always develop/implement each of the items, features, components, etc to be built to be advanced, robust, fully integrated with each other.
- give me a confirmation of completion to 100% for each item, feature, component etc you work on
- generate concise summary of completed tasks each time you complete them
