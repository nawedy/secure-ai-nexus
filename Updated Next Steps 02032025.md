Here's the updated plan, based on these documents, to reflect the project's progress and goals:

Project Understanding (from the documents):

Goal: Build a secure platform for LLMs and Generative AI, with a strong focus on security and privacy.
Backend: 60% complete, with core components like authentication, API endpoints, LLM integration, middleware, and security components partially implemented.
Frontend: 45% complete, with basic UI, partial API integration, and core setup in place.
DevOps: 40% complete, with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD partially configured.
Documentation: 35% complete, with basic API and security documentation.
Overall Progress: 45% complete
MVP Target: 3-5 weeks.
Production Target: 7-9 weeks.
Immediate Priorities (from the documents):

Complete Authentication System:
Backend: Finish login, registration, session management, secure token handling, password management, and password reset.
Frontend: Finalize login, registration, and password reset forms, secure token storage, and protected routes.
Implement Security Middleware:
Backend: Develop middleware for authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
Frontend: Ensure secure API calls using authentication tokens.
Add Form Validation:
Backend: Implement data validation in API endpoints and database models.
Frontend: Use form and input validation to validate user input.
Set Up Production Deployment:
DevOps: Finalize Docker and Kubernetes, set up CI/CD, and implement monitoring and alerting.
Implement Error Handling:
Backend: Implement global error handling.
Frontend: Add error handling components.
Next Steps (Detailed Plan):

Given the immediate priorities, we'll start with the authentication system and then progressively work on the other high-priority items.

Phase 1: Complete Authentication System (Backend)

File: src/api/endpoints/auth.py
Task:
Implement the following API endpoints:
POST /api/auth/register: User registration (handle username, email, password, etc.).
POST /api/auth/login: User login (handle username/email, password, token generation).
POST /api/auth/password-reset: Password reset (handle request, validation and change).
Add validation for each request.
Use secure hashing for passwords (e.g., bcrypt).
Generate JWTs or other secure tokens.
Handle errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
File: src/auth.py
Task:
Implement the logic for user registration (create user, store password).
Implement the logic for user login (verify credentials, generate token).
Implement the logic for password reset (verify email, send email, change password).
Implement token management (generation, refresh, validation).
File: src/database/models.py
Task:
Define the user model (username, email, password hash, etc.).
File: src/middleware/auth.py
Task:
Add authentication middleware to protect the endpoints.
Phase 2: Complete Authentication System (Frontend)

File: src/app/login/page.tsx
Task:
Create a login form with fields for username/email and password.
Handle form submission and send credentials to the /api/auth/login endpoint.
Store the authentication token securely.
Handle login errors and display appropriate messages.
Add input validation.
File: src/app/signup/page.tsx
Task:
Create a registration form with fields for username, email, and password.
Handle form submission and send data to the /api/auth/register endpoint.
Handle registration errors and display appropriate messages.
Add input validation.
File: src/app/password-reset/page.tsx
Task:
Create a form to handle password reset request.
Create a form to change the password.
Add input validation.
File: src/middleware/
Task:
Create middleware to handle authentication.
File: src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
Task:
Review the implementation and update it if necessary.
Phase 3: Implement Security Middleware (Backend)

File: src/middleware/auth.py
Task:
Implement authentication middleware to protect routes that require a token.
Verify the token and extract user information.
Add an authorization logic.
File: src/middleware/validation.py
Task:
Implement input validation middleware to validate API requests.
Sanitize user inputs to prevent security issues.
File: src/middleware/rate_limiter.py
Task:
Implement rate limiting middleware.
File: src/middleware/security.py
Task:
Add secure headers.
Phase 4: Implement Security Middleware (Frontend)

Update components:
Task:
Update the components to use the authentication token in the requests.
File: src/middleware/
Task:
Create middleware to handle input validation.
Phase 5: Add form validation (Backend and Frontend)

Backend:
Task: Add data validation to each API endpoint to validate the input.
Frontend:
Task: Add form and input validation to each form.
Phase 6: Set up Production Deployment (DevOps)

Task: Finalize Docker and Kubernetes configurations.
Task: Set up the CI/CD pipeline using cloudbuild.yaml.
Task: Implement monitoring and alerting using Prometheus.
Phase 7: Implement Error Handling

Backend:
Task: Implement global error handling using src/middleware/error_handler.py
Frontend:
Task: Add error handling components.
