## Azure-Specific Recommendations
1. Implement Azure Security Center best practices
2. Complete Azure AD B2C integration for identity management
3. Set up Azure Front Door for WAF and DDoS protection
4. Configure Azure Monitor and Log Analytics
5. Implement Azure Key Vault rotation policies
6. Set up Azure Private Link for all services
7. Configure Azure Backup and DR solutions

## Critical Azure Security Gaps
1. Incomplete Azure AD integration
2. Missing Azure Front Door protection
3. Incomplete Azure Monitor setup
4. Missing Azure Private Link configurations
5. Incomplete Azure Key Vault usage
6. Missing Azure Security Center integration

## Next Steps
1. Complete Azure AD B2C integration
2. Implement Azure Front Door
3. Set up Azure Monitor completely
4. Configure Azure Security Center
5. Implement Azure Private Link
6. Complete Azure Key Vault integration

## Notes
- Current implementation needs stronger Azure service integration
- AI security features need Azure-specific implementations
- Compliance features need Azure Policy integration
- Advanced protection needs Azure Front Door implementation
- Monitoring needs complete Azure Monitor integration
