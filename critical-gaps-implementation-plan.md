# Critical Gaps Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan to address the critical gaps identified in the project. Our focus is on the core backend API logic, security enhancements, and enhancing monitoring & DevOps to ensure we are ready for production deployment.

## Core Backend API Logic

### Authentication
- [ ] **Implement User Authentication Endpoints** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Create `login` endpoint (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Create `signup` endpoint (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Create `password reset` endpoint (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Implement secure user authentication endpoints for login, signup, and password reset.
- [ ] **Integrate with Frontend** (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
    - [ ] Update the front end to use the new endpoints.
    - *Description:* Update the front end to consume the previously created authentication endpoints.

### Data Validation
- [ ] **Implement Input Validation** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Validate user registration data (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Validate login credentials (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Validate password reset requests (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Implement robust input validation for all API endpoints to prevent data inconsistencies and potential security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Implement Error Handling** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Handle invalid user data (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Handle authentication failures (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Handle internal server errors (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Implement error handling for all possible scenarios, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

### Secure Endpoints
- [ ] **Secure All Endpoints** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Implement JWT authentication for protected routes (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - [ ] Add authorization checks (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Secure all API endpoints with proper authentication (JWT) and authorization mechanisms.

## Security Enhancements

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] **Implement Advanced Rate Limiting** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Configure rate limits for login attempts (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - [ ] Configure rate limits for API requests (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Implement advanced rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

### IP Blocking
- [ ] **Implement IP Blocking System** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Detect suspicious IP addresses (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - [ ] Block malicious IP addresses (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Implement a system to detect and block malicious IP addresses based on suspicious activity.

### Security Headers
- [ ] **Implement Security Headers** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Add `Content-Security-Policy` header (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Add `X-Content-Type-Options` header (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Add `Strict-Transport-Security` header (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Add `X-Frame-Options` header (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - *Description:* Implement security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### Form Validation
- [ ] **Finalize Form Validation** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Ensure all frontend forms validate user inputs (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - [ ] Ensure all backend endpoints validate user inputs (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Add validation to forms in the front end, and validate inputs for endpoints in the back end.

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Implement remaining Error Handling** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Ensure that all the application has error handling.
  - *Description:* Add error handling to all the application to avoid unhandled exceptions and to make sure the user sees a friendly error page.

## Enhancing Monitoring & DevOps

### Production Deployment
- [ ] **Set Up Production Deployment Configuration** (Estimated Duration: 3 days)
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for production (Estimated Duration: 0.5 days)
  - [ ] Set up deployment scripts (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - [ ] Set up a production environment (Estimated Duration: 1.5 days)
  - *Description:* Set up all the configuration needed for a production environment.

### Monitoring
- [ ] **Implement Basic Monitoring** (Estimated Duration: 2 days)
  - [ ] Configure monitoring tools (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - [ ] Set up basic health checks (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
  - *Description:* Implement basic monitoring for the system to ensure it is running smoothly.

## Deployment verification
- [ ] **Create a script to verify deployment** (Estimated Duration: 1 day)
   - [ ] Test the API endpoints (Estimated duration: 0.5 day)
   - [ ] Test the front end (Estimated duration: 0.5 day)
   - *Description:* Create a script that will run after a deployment, to make sure that everything is working as expected.

**Progress Tracking:**

-   Checkboxes are provided for each task and subtask.
-   Use `[x]` to mark a task as complete.
-   Use `[ ]` to indicate an incomplete task.

**Note:** Durations are estimates and may vary based on the complexity of implementation.
