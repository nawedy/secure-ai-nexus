# SecureAI Platform Security Guide

## Security Architecture
The platform implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

1. Network Security
   - Azure Application Gateway WAF
   - Network isolation
   - DDoS protection
   - TLS 1.3 enforcement

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - Azure AD integration
   - MFA requirement
   - RBAC implementation
   - JWT token validation

3. Data Protection
   - AES-256 encryption at rest
   - TLS for data in transit
   - Key rotation policies
   - Secure key management

## Security Controls

### Access Control
1. Role Definitions
   ```yaml
   roles:
     admin:
       - full system access
       - security configuration
       - audit log access
     operator:
       - model deployment
       - monitoring access
     reader:
       - read-only access
       - metrics viewing
   ```

2. Authentication Methods
   - Azure AD SSO
   - Service Principal authentication
   - API key authentication (limited use)

### Monitoring & Alerts
1. Security Monitoring
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Anomaly detection
   - Access pattern analysis
   - Resource monitoring

2. Alert Configuration
   ```yaml
   alerts:
     authentication:
       - failed_attempts: >5 in 5m
       - mfa_bypass_attempts: any
     model_access:
       - unauthorized_attempts: any
       - suspicious_patterns: any
   ```

## Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance measures
- HIPAA security controls
- SOC 2 requirements
- Data residency controls
