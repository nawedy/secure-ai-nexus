Immediate Actions (Concurrent Steps)

Security Core Validation (Critical):
Objective: Ensure core security mechanisms are in place and functioning.
Actions:
Inspect src/security/encryption.py: Verify the encryption algorithms and key management processes.
Inspect src/security/io_validation.py: Check how input validation is implemented. Look for checks against common injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
Inspect src/security/auth.py: Check how authentication is implemented, what type of tokens are being used and how session management works.
Inspect src/middleware/security.py: confirm that the implemented security functions are properly called.
Inspect src/middleware/validation.py: confirm that the implemented validation functions are properly called.
Expected Output: A summary of the security measures and potential vulnerabilities in these files.
API Core Functionality (Critical):
Objective: Verify the core API and LLM interaction are functional.
Actions:
Inspect src/main.py: Understand how the API is initialized, and how the LLM services are integrated.
Inspect src/model_service.py: Examine how the LLM models are called, how prompts are sent, and how responses are processed.
Inspect src/api/router.py, src/api/routes.py: Map out the API endpoints and how requests are handled.
Inspect src/api/endpoints/auth.py: confirm that the authentication endpoint is implemented.
Inspect src/api/endpoints/health.py: confirm that the health check endpoint is implemented.
Inspect src/api/endpoints/monitoring.py: confirm that the monitoring endpoint is implemented.
Expected Output: Confirmation of basic API structure, LLM model integration, and request/response flow.
Authentication Flow (Critical):
Objective: Ensure users can register and log in securely.
Actions:
Inspect src/auth.py: Confirm user registration and login logic. Check for password hashing, and secure session handling.
Inspect src/app/login/page.tsx, src/app/signup/page.tsx: Understand the frontend login/signup forms and how they interact with the backend.
Expected Output: Confirmation of the registration/login process and secure session management.
Deployment Readiness (Important):
Objective: Ensure the platform is ready for deployment.
Actions:
Inspect Dockerfile: Verify that the image build instructions are correct and up-to-date.
Inspect docker-compose.yml: Check the configuration for the different services (backend, database, etc.).
Inspect cloudbuild.yaml: Ensure the CI/CD pipeline is configured to build and deploy the platform.
Inspect k8s/: Verify that the kubernetes configurations are set up to deploy the platform properly.
Expected Output: Confirmation of correct container configurations and a working CI/CD pipeline.
How I Will Execute These Steps

File Reading: I will use the read_file tool to examine the specified files in each action.
Internal Analysis: I will analyze the code within the files to understand the implementation of each component.
Concise Summaries: After analyzing each file, I'll provide a concise summary of the key findings and potential issues.
Combined Output: I will organize the output from these steps into a single, coherent response for easy review.
