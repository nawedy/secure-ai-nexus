# SecureAI Platform - Comprehensive Status Report
Date: February 3, 2025

## Project Focus: Critical Gaps Implementation

We are currently focused on addressing the critical gaps identified in our recent audit. The priority is to enhance the core functionality and security of the platform before proceeding with further feature development or comprehensive documentation. Documentation will be addressed after the critical gaps are resolved.

### Key Areas of Focus:

1.  **Core Backend API Logic:**
    *   Implementing full authentication logic.
    *   Ensuring all endpoints are secure and error-handled.
    * Implementing data validation for all the endpoints.
2.  **Security Enhancements:**
    *   Completing advanced security features (advanced rate limiting, IP blocking, security headers).
    *   Finalizing form validation.
    * Implementing remaining error handling.
3.  **Enhancing Monitoring & DevOps:**
    * Setting up production deployment.
    * Implementing basic monitoring for the system.
    * Adding a Deployment verification step.
