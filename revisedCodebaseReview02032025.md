Revised Go-To-Market Plan (End of Day Today)

Now that I understand this is an LLM/Generative AI platform, here's a drastically different and more appropriate go-to-market plan:

Phase 1: Essential Functionality and Security Focus (Now - 2 hours)

Core API Functionality:
Verify that src/main.py and src/model_service.py are operational.
Ensure at least one LLM or generative AI model integration is working, allowing for basic input and output.
Confirm the ability to send requests to the model and receive generated output.
Basic Authentication:
Verify that src/auth.py and the relevant frontend components (src/app/login/page.tsx, src/app/signup/page.tsx) allow users to sign up and log in.
Confirm the use of JWTs or another secure session management method.
Security Core:
Prioritize src/security/encryption.py, src/security/io_validation.py, and src/security/auth.py.
Ensure input validation is working to protect against common vulnerabilities.
Confirm that data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
Verify that API keys or other authentication credentials are being handled securely.
Deployment:
Confirm that the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, cloudbuild.yaml and k8s/ configurations are working to deploy the platform.
Use the scripts scripts/docker-build.sh to build and test the image.
Use scripts/deploy.sh to deploy.
Monitoring:
Verify the monitoring configurations defined in prometheus.yml and in the k8s/ files.
Phase 2: Quick Testing and Security Auditing (2 - 3 hours)

Manual Testing:
Send requests to the API with different types of inputs (including potentially malicious ones).
Verify that the correct output is generated.
Check that security features like input validation and rate limiting are working as expected.
Test user registration, login, and session management.
Automated Tests:
Run all existing automated tests in tests/, especially focusing on security tests.
Fix any critical errors.
Security Audit:
Conduct a rapid manual audit of the security configurations and code.
Focus on authentication, input validation, data encryption, and secure API handling.
Phase 3: Minimal Marketing and Documentation (3 - 4 hours)

Landing Page:
Create a basic landing page describing the platform's capabilities.
Highlight the privacy and security features.
Explain how users can sign up and access the LLMs.
Include any initial pricing or usage plans.
API Documentation:
Ensure that the basic API documentation is available in docs/api/.
Include information on authentication, request formats, and response formats.
Security Documentation:
Write a very brief overview of the platform's security measures in docs/security/.
Social Media/Email:
Create a post or email describing the launch.
Phase 4: Go-Live (4-5 hours)

Deployment Verification:
Confirm that the platform is accessible and usable.
Monitor logs for any immediate errors.
Soft Launch:
Announce the launch via social media, email, and the website.
Gather initial user feedback, especially on security and usability.
Monitoring:
Use the monitoring configurations and code to monitor the app.
Phase 5: Post Launch (5+ hours)

Monitoring: Monitor the app closely after launch
Fixing Address and issues as they occur
Improvement Plan for future improvements and features
Key Considerations

Security: Security is paramount. Ensure that the core security mechanisms are in place.
LLM Integration: At least one model needs to be operational for this initial launch.
Privacy: Be transparent about how user data is handled.
Testing: Focus on security-related testing.
Marketing: Emphasize the security and privacy aspects in marketing.
Documentation: Provide basic documentation for users and developers.
Next Steps

Security: Begin by focusing on the core security functions, especially those in src/security/.
API: Verify that src/main.py, src/model_service.py, and the src/api/ endpoints are functioning.
Communication: I'm here to support you. Keep me updated on progress and any issues that come up.
